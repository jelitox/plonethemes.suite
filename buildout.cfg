[buildout]

# By default, zc.buildout doesnâ€™t unzip zip-safe eggs packages. This 
# follows the policy followed by setuptools itself. Experience shows 
# this policy to to be inconvenient. Zipped eggs make debugging more 
# difficult and often import more slowly.
# You can include an unzip option in the buildout section to change 
# the default unzipping policy.

# It is very useful when you using the omelette recipe for debugging 
# python eggs packages
