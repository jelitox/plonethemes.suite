Introduction
============


The idea of this buildout configuration is to install the latest version 
of Plone 4.3.x, along with many Diazo themes,, Plone theme skins and useful 
theming tools for layout, custom icons and fonts and third-party theming 
add-ons.

The idea is create a bring with the *Designers* for changing Plone's visual 
appearance.


Motivation
----------

Plone lacks out of the box support for custom, extensible, templating support 
for *Designers* and *Content editors*.
